                <h5>Motto</h5>
                <p>“We can make a Difference. We must make a Difference.”</p>
                <p>
                    Saathi is a non-governmental organization established in 1992 to
                    address the different forms of violence and discrimination faced by
                    Nepali women and girls. It was the first organization that was
                    instrumental in drawing significant national attention towards
                    domestic violence in Nepal as an area requiring urgent attention and
                    intervention to break the silence that impacts the lives of many
                    marginalized women and girls. It has persistently continued its
                    crusade for creating a safe and violence-free society where women and
                    children can live with respect and dignity.
                </p>
                <h5>Our Vision</h5>
                <p>
                    “A just and peaceful society where individuals can enjoy their
                    fundamental rights to lead a violence-free life regardless of their
                    sex and gender”
                </p>
                <h5>Our Mission</h5>
                <p>
                    “Create violence free homes and society where women and children can
                    live a life of dignity”
                </p>

                <h5>Institutional landscape</h5>
                <p>
                    Saathi has a family of 75 staff members (74% female) working across
                    the country. Saathi's head office is in Lalitpur District, while its
                    district offices are in Kathmandu, Banke, Kapilvastu, Kanchanpur and
                    Bardiya with also presence in Kailali, Baglung, Pokhara, Dang,
                    Dadeldhura, Sindhupalchowk, Bajhang, Achham, Dolkha, Makwanpur,
                    Siraha, and Mahottari. Nevertheless, Saathi's outreach is beyond the
                    areas where it has physical presence and nationwide as Saathi believes
                    in partnering with and capacitating already existing community
                    organizations at the local level.
